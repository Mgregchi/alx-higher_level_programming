Using ``matrix_mul``
-------------------
Multiplies two matrices

Checks if m_a and m_b are both lists
Checks if m_a and m_b are both lists of lists
Checks if m_a and m_b are not empty
Checks if m_a and m_b contain only integers or floats
Checks if m_a and m_b are both rectangles (that is, that all rows have the same number of elements)
Checks if m_a and m_b can be multiplied
Returns the result of multiplying m_a and m_b

First import ``matrix_mul``:

    >>> matrix_mul = __import__('100-matrix_mul').matrix_mul

Now use it:

Basic usage:
    >>> m_a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    >>> m_b = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
    [[19, 22], [43, 50]]

Inputs that are not lisits:
    >>> m_a = 'hello'
    >>> m_b = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
    TypeError: m_a must be a list or m_b must be a list

    >>> m_a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    >>> m_b = {1: 2, 3: 4}
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
    TypeError: m_a must be a list or m_b must be a list


Inputs that are not lists of lists:

	>>> m_a = [[1, 2], 3, 4]
	>>> m_b = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
	>>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  ...
	TypeError: m_a must be a list of lists or m_b must be a list of lists

	>>> m_a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
	>>> m_b = [[1, 2], {3: 4}]
	>>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  ...
	TypeError: m_a must be a list of lists or m_b must be a list of lists

Empty inputs:

	>>> m_a = []
	>>> m_b = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
	>>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  ...
	ValueError: m_a can't be empty or m_b can't be empty

Inputs that contain elements that are not integers or floats:

	>>> m_a = [[1, 2], ['a', 'b']]
	>>> m_b = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
	>>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  ...
	TypeError: m_a should contain only integers or floats or m_b should contain only integers or floats

	>>> m_a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
	>>> m_b = [[1, 2], ['a', 'b']]
	>>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  ...
	TypeError: m_a should contain only integers or floats or m_b should contain only integers or floats


Inputs that are not rectangles (that is, that have rows of different lengths):

	>>> m_a = [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]
	>>> m_b = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
	>>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  ...
	TypeError: each row of m_a must be of the same size or each row of m_b must be of the same size

	>>> m_a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
	>>> m_b = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]
	>>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  ...
	TypeError: each row of m_a must be of the same size or each row of m_b must be of the same size

Inputs that cannot be multiplied:

	>>> m_a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
	>>> m_b = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
	>>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  ...
	ValueError: m_a and m_b can't be multiplied

	>>> m_a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
	>>> m_b = [[1], [2], [3]]
	>>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  ...
	ValueError: m_a and m_b can't be multiplied
